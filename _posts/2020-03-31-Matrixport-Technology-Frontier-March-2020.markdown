### Summary
- There is a proposal to introduce a suite of new features on BTC via soft fork in 2020. These features should further improve the network’s privacy and efficiency. However, given past records, we’re not optimistic about the proposed timeline and viability of the final launch.

- The long awaited ETH 2.0 is scheduled for release in July 2020. The latest completed audit shows that ETH 2.0 spec is well designed, with only minor changes required. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin’s idea of improving ETH’s privacy and efficiency simultaneously is substantiated by the advancement in Loopring and Aztec.

- USDT is launched on BCH using SLP protocol.

- Other blockchains such as Qtum, Ontology, Cosmos etc. are also making steady progress in their technical development. Among them, the most exciting development is Cosmos’s publishing of IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) demo, a big step taken towards connecting all blockchains.
- The recent flurry of security incidents has further weakened people’s trust of centralized exchanges. However, Defi, the widely believed solution, is also struggling with its own protocol security issues. Recent examples include the clamp attack on Curve, the double spending bug of OmniCore, etc.

### Public Blockchain: Top 10
**Pedro Febrero’s vision about Bitcoin in 2020**

*Opinion***

**Ontology launched P2P Claim**
*# PoS; smart contract; account*

- Enables people to people, things to things, affairs to affairs to authorize and authenticate each other（Implementation**）

**Cosmos published IBC demo**
*# BPoS; cross chain*

- IBC: Inter-Blockchain Communication

- Including: real proofs, end-to-end handshakes and working token transfers
