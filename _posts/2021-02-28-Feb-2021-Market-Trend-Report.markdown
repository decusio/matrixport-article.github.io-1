Rick Rieder, chief investment officer at BlackRock Financial Management, hinted that the firm has already invested a percentage of its portfolio into crypto. In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box on Wednesday, Rieder said BlackRock has started to invest in crypto. In his opinion, blockchain technology and related regulations have evolved to the point where a number of people should have some Bitcoin holdings as part of their portfolio for diversification and return.

Motley Fool, a popular investment advisory service firm is buying $5m worth of Bitcoin from its own balance sheet for its 10X portfolio, a portfolio that recommends subscribers and invests their own money in assets that the firm believes will grow tenfold in the next few years. Motley Fool will be buying Bitcoin directly and not through any ETFs or trusts. The firm has recommended the digital asset as a core holding to all its 10X portfolio subscribers and has provided time for them to purchase BTC before The Motley Fool initiates its own purchase. It added that the company will also be separately buying $5 million in Bitcoin onto its own balance sheet in a few weeks’ time.

MicroStrategy continues to increase its Bitcoin holding. The business intelligence firm announced bitcoin purchases worth over a billion dollars in February. To date, MicroStrategy holds over 90,000 BTC in its corporate treasury account.

**Commentary: Unlike previous instances, where many institutions only express positive sentiments, they have gotten off the sidelines and invested their capital into bitcoin. Compared to the earlier wave of institutional investors, the latest wave of investors comes with deeper pockets and willingness to hold the novel asset class for a longer duration. Some of the earlier investors such as MicroStrategy are also doubling down on the space. Increased institutional participation will help diversify the cryptocurrency market and aid its development as a globally recognized asset class.**

Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten has allowed users to spend Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at merchants throughout Japan. According to a recent announcement, users of Rakuten's cryptocurrency wallet can now exchange BTC, ETH and BCH for the firm’s e-money, Rakuten Cash, and deposit into the Pay app and Point credit card. The move means customers can pay with crypto at thousands of merchants across Japan that accept Rakuten Pay and Rakuten Point Card. Rakuten also announced that it will be integrating its crypto wallet into the Pay app.

Google Finance has started a dedicated “crypto” tab on its website. Right at the top of the page, where users can “compare markets,” cryptocurrencies are listed among the five default markets, which also include U.S., Europe, Asia and Currencies. At the moment, Google Finance only tracks a limited number of cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH.

**Commentary: In the past, many doubters believe that cryptocurrency was just a bubble and will never have any real-world utility. However, as the industry continues its unabated growth, there have been more examples of real-world adoption and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Rakuten’s adoption of crypto as a form of payment is one of the latest examples of payment providers accepting crypto as currencies. Google’s dedicated crypto tab helps to bring more attention and legitimacy to the industry. As such developments continue, the industry should continue to grow and gain acceptance.**

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which is preparing to trade publicly in the next few months, is being valued at $77 billion, based on trading of the company’s privately held shares on a secondary market. Coinbase is running an anonymous order book on a private stock market ahead of the company’s direct public listing, the date for which is still unknown. The sale allows current and former employees, as well as investors in Coinbase, to take some cash off the table.

**Commentary: Coinbase listing on the US market is one of the latest breakthroughs within the cryptocurrency industry. Following the listing of mining hardware manufacturer and crypto asset management firm, Coinbase is largest crypto-related firm to be listed. This listing is expected to open the gates for future listing of crypto-related firms. Should Coinbase valuation continue to soar after listing, this will help to boost the prices of many exchange-linked tokens such as BNB and UNI as investors look to pile into the space.**

Grayscale Bitcoin premium flips negative as BTC stays below $50,000. The gap between the GBTC share price and the implied price of the underlying bitcoin has collapsed to a 4% discount from a 35% premium late last year. Analysts speculated the shrinking premium might be due to reduced demand for bitcoin, or due to increasing competition among providers of bitcoin-focused exchange-traded products.
One day after GBTC’s flip to discount, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) also traded at a discount. The trust closed 5.21% below the price of ETH after trading at a premium to the spot price of ether since 2017. Earlier in the month, it traded at a premium that was nearly 20% above the spot price.

**Commentary: After trading in premium for much of the bull market, the sudden drop in Grayscale’s trust prices versus their net assets is quite surprising. This could signify a few things: (1) Institutional investors’ interest might be waning as GBTC and ETHE were the main tools for institutional investors to invest in the asset class, a drop in premium may signify they are no longer as bullish, (2) Increased competition within the trust space, more competitors are offering cheaper and better alternatives resulting in investors switching over, (3) Such trusts are not a perfect proxy/alternative to the real underlying assets, investors who bought at a premium probably suffered a larger loss when the trust flipped to a discount compared to an investor who holds the underlying asset.**

**Commentary: After DeFi summer boom in 2020, the sector cooled off slightly in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, it looks to be picking up steam again in early 2021 as multiple projects look to introduce new products and services. User and trading volumes have been trending up and new funds are looking to invest into the space.
