The biggest news of this month in the crypto industry is without doubt about the new European Commission’s proposed MiCA regulations. This new legislative proposal pays special attention to stablecoins and plans to introduce more stringent requirements for them. This obviously shows an overture to the crypto industry by the EU, as it determines to establish a regulatory framework to govern the new industry. On the other hand, it certainly poses challenges (financial-wise mainly) to new start-up companies wanting to explore business opportunities in the EU markets. Let’s have a look at this news in details, as well as at other regulatory stories of this month:

EU to see comprehensive crypto regulation by 2024

The European Union, or EU, plans to incorporate crypto and blockchain technology into its main processes by 2024. Over the next four years, the economic union aims to firm up fresh regulations that will promote blockchain and digital asset usage for international money transfers, according to internal documents that Reuters reported in early September. 

European Commission adopts digital finance package for crypto and blockchain

The European Commission is moving to provide more legal clarity and certainty for the cryptocurrency industry in its member states. On Sept. 24, the EC officially adopted a new digital finance package including digital finance and retail payments strategies, as well as legislative proposals on crypto assets. The EC said that the new package represents the first time that the authority proposed new legislation on crypto assets. As part of the new legislative proposals, the EC pays special attention to stablecoins — a type of cryptocurrency that pegs value to an external reference like the United States dollar or an algorithm. Specifically, the proposals aim to introduce more stringent requirements for stablecoin issuers in terms of capital, investor rights, and supervision, the text of the proposal reads. Therein, the EC aims to require stablecoin issuers to complete authorization by a national competent authority if the outstanding amount of stablecoins is above 5 million euro ($5.8 million). The authority also wants to oblige crypto asset issuers to publish a white paper with mandatory disclosure requirements. Small and medium-sized enterprises will be exempted from the publication of such a white paper where the total consideration of the offering of crypto assets is less than 1 million euro ($1.1 million) over a period of 12 months. The exclusion makes sure that “the requirements imposed on crypto-asset service providers are proportionate to the risks created by the services provided.” 

Blockchain industry raises concerns over EC’s proposed crypto regulations

Major players in the global cryptocurrency community have addressed the European Commission’s new legislative proposals on digital assets. The International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications, or INATBA, has released an initial response to the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations proposed by the EC. The association features major crypto companies like Ripple, ConsenSys, and Iota. In its official response to the EC, the INATBA members expressed the industry’s concerns over the proposed MiCA regulations, calling the authority to bring their forces together in further development of the regulatory framework. While the INATBA generally sees the MiCA as a positive step that aims to establish regulatory clarity, some of its members outlined a number of significant concerns.

For example, they claim that in its present form, the MiCA could “overburden a young and innovative industry with costly and complex compliance and legal requirements that are disproportionate to the policy objectives it pursues.” The association expressed hope that the EC will provide supportive measures to ensure that the MiCA does not stifle innovation within the European Union and cause the EU-based firms to flee to non-EU countries.
