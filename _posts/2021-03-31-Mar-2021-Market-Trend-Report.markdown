Morgan Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket, the incoming debt instrument, is long on MicroStrategy, Square, Riot Blockchain and NVIDIA with positions in 11 companies in total.

Zurich-based private bank NPB Neue Privat Bank AG is launching its digital asset banking and custody services through a partnership with InCore Bank AG. The bank will provide clients with a simple way to trade major cryptocurrencies on their platform and provide custodian services for their assets.

Goldman Sachs has announced it will be offering crypto to its private wealth management (PWM) clients and has appointed a new global head to manage the segments. The unit will work with advisors to educate clients about the digital assets and blockchain technology. The bank will offer a full spectrum of investments in digital assets, including spot trading, derivatives, and other crypto-related investment vehicles. This news came after Goldman Sachs relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk after a three-year hiatus.

**Commentary: Financial heavyweights are broadening their exposure to the nascent asset class. With more banks, particularly mega banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, entering the market and expanding their presence, it is likely the cryptocurrency industry will receive a new boost of capital and resources for future innovation. Overall, this is a very positive signs for the market and long-term development.**

In the latest announcement, Ripple Labs and MoneyGram have decided to wind down their partnership agreement. Ripple had been paying MoneyGram to use XRP token in international settlement since 2019, with MoneyGram netting $61.5m in market development fee from Ripple. The partnership was put on hold in February 2021 after US SEC investigated Ripple and its practices. Both sides commented that they are “committed” to revisiting their partnership in the future.

Ripple acquires 40% stake in an Asian remittance payments specialist, Tranglo, to meet growing customer demand. Ripple said its investment in Tranglo is a part of its commitment to enhancing the payments ecosystem in Southeast Asia. The move also coincides with Ripple’s office expansion in Southeast Asia as it continues to scale up operations in the region.

**Commentary: The ongoing investigations into Ripple and its illegal practices have continued to weigh down on Ripple’s business. The partnership with MoneyGram was the next domino to fall under the pressure. To help alleviate its position within the cross-border payments space, Ripple has embarked on new projects and investment within the Southeast Asia space, particularly in the cross-border payment sector. As the Southeast Asia payment space is highly fragmented, it boasts potential huge rewards, and should Ripple be successful, the new partnership with Tranglo could yield even better returns for the company, as well as its token XRP.**

Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX), is releasing its third iteration on its mainnet on May 5 and will be integrating Uniswap v3 with its previous edition. The latest version aims to improve Uniswap’s ability as an automated market maker (AMM), providing it with additional flexibility and efficiency. The new key change is focused on the concept of “concentrated liquidity”, where liquidity providers (LP) can set minimum and maximum prices on their portion of liquidity of any given pool, giving them more control over the price ranges in which their capital is used.

Uniswap has licensed the third iteration of its code bank in an apparent move to ward off would-be copycats. To prevent future rival projects such as SushiSwap from copying its creation, Uniswap has appealed for a business source license that would delay any commercial use of their codes for up to two years. With the license, no one can copy Uniswap’s code base wholesale, a departure from the open-source nature of most cryptocurrency project.

With the announcement of Uniswap v3, rivals are starting to speed up their plans to build alternatives or improve their protocols. Integral, a new AMM designed with a baked-in order book, went live in March, as it hopes siphon liquidity away from DEX like Uniswap with its approach to impermanent loss and order book mirroring. Utilizing the concept of vampire attacks, it is taking the idea one step further by “mirroring” liquidity on itself to gain adoption. Integral will mirror snapshots of Binance’s order book onto the AMM to artificially create depth accompanied by Uniswap’s prices from Uniswap’s own price oracles. Other AMMs have also went live in the last month with the aim of getting a slice of the growing pie.

**Commentary: Innovation and competition within the DeFi space continues unabated. In the latest bid to fend off rivals such as SushiSwap and PancakeSwap, Uniswap has announced its plans to launch the 3rd iteration of its popular protocol. While the new concept is interesting and appealing to LPs, it remains unknown if Uniswap is able to protect its faltering market share and regain some lost grounds. While Uniswap continues to innovate, other competitors (both upstarts and current ones) have started to launch new products to gain a slice of the growing DEX space.**

Blockchain platform Enjin has secured $18.9m fundraise in a bid to migrate its upcoming product Effinity to Polkadot. It plans to transition to Polkadot to save users from the soaring gas fees on the Ethereum network and help to increase scalability for its upcoming NFT platform.
